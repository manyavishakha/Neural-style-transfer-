BATCH DURATION : December 25th, 2024 to January 25th, 2025

MENTOR NAME : NEELA SANTHOSH

DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK: THIS PROJECT CONTAINS INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS PLATFORMS LIKE YOUTUBE, GOOGLE , META AI , CHAT GPT AND MANY OTHER WEBSITES. UNDERSTANDING THE GOAL WHAT WE HAVE TO BUILD, IT'S A PYTHON SCRIPT THAT SUMMARIZES LONG ARTICLES INTO SHORT SUMMARY. FOR THIS SCRIPT I TOOK HELP FROM MENTOR AND FROM THE YOUTUBE VIDEO. I GOT TO KNOW ABOUT ALL THESE FROM LINKDLN AND WHATSAPP GROUP WHICH KEEP US UPDATED BY PROVIDING THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING THIS COURSE AND ALSO, OUR MENTOR HELPS US IN EVERY WAY TO MAKE US UNDERSTAND THE TASK EASYILY. THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT SUMMARIZATION TOOL WHICH KEEP ARTICLES SHORT TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT QUICKLY. THIS HELPS STUDENTS AS WELL AS PROFESSIONALS AND RESEARCHERS TO EFFICIENTLY SUMMARIZES LARGE SIZE OF TEXTS AND SAVES A LOT OF TIME . IT FOCUSES ON KEY POINTS WITHOUT READING WHOLE DATA AND INFORMATION. USERS CAN USE THE DESIRED SUMMARY LENGHT ACCORDING TO THEIR WANTS AND IDENTIFIES KEY PHRASES OR TERMS IN SHORT PARAGRAPHS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK TEAM.OF CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS TO PROVIDE US THIS WOMNDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW ABOUT SOMETHING VERY NEW AND DIFFERENT FROM MY FIELD. IT'S REALLY A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR ME TO DO A PROJECT ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS. NOW I WOULD TO SHARE THAT HOW I CAME TO KNOW ABOUT THIS PLATFORM. I WAS GOING THOROUGH LINKDLN AND SUDDENLY CAME ACROSS THOROUGH A POST REGARDING INTERNSHIP. SO I APPLIED THOROUGH THAT PRCOESS AND GOT SELECTED .
THIS SCRIPT IS ABOUT NEURAL STYLE TRANSFER .

Neural Style Transfer is a deep learning technique that combines the content of one image with the style of another image. It uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from both images and then transforms the content image to match the style of the reference image.

The process involves:

- Extracting features from the content image
- Extracting style features from the reference image
- Combining the content features with the style features
- Generating a new image that combines the content and style

Neural Style Transfer allows for the creation of unique and artistic images that blend the characteristics of two different images. It has applications in art, design, and image editing, and has been used to create stunning works of art that blend reality and fantasy.
